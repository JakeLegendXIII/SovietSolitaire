# SovietSolitaire

Basic Solitaire Game using a 36 card deck. The suits are made up of 6-10 numbers and the 4 face cards.
The rules are similar to Klondike Solitaire but adapted for a smaller deck. Face cards can be stacked in any order.
Numbers must be stacked like in Klondike (alternating colors, descending order).
There are 9 slots and 1 place at the top to place a single card to help you make moves.
When completing face card stacks, they are flipped over and that slot is no longer able to be used.
